# Introduction
This is Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course, Week 4 peer-graded project assignment.
The purpose of this project is for the learner to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

# Dataset Input
The data for the project represent data collected from the experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, it captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
